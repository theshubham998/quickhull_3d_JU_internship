# quickhull_3d_JU_internship
I have implemented a feature extraction algorithm based on standard convex hull algorithms in 3D space. This is part of a hand gesture recognition project using Kinect sensors.

This is a C++ project, and once you compile and build the .exe will be created in the bin folder.
